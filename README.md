# ðŸš—ðŸ’¤ AI-Powered Driver Drowsiness and Yawning Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Drowsy driving is a major cause of road accidents globally. This project introduces a **real-time driver drowsiness detection system** using **computer vision and deep learning** to identify different driver states:
- **Drowsy**
- **Non-Drowsy**
- **Yawn**
- **No Yawn**

The system leverages **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** and **Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)** for precise classification and alerts drivers to prevent accidents.
